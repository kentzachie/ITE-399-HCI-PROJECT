                        PHINMA Cagayan de Oro College was established back in 1948 as Parent-Teacher College
                        – a nonpolitical and nonsectarian educational institution. The school served the youth and working
                        individuals by providing education from the primary to the tertiary levels. In the next 30 years,
                        PHINMA COC expanded its course offerings to include Computer Science, Engineering, and Mass
                        Communications.<br><br>

                        PHINMA COC was acquired in 2005 by PHINMA, making it one of the conglomerate’s first investments in
                        the educational sector. Through PHINMA’s leadership and management, the college improved its
                        existing academic programs by employing non-traditional approaches to learning.

                        enabling them to identify their passions, interests, and skills. Through self-reflection and evaluation,
                        students can align their educational choices and career aspirations, fostering a clearer trajectory toward
                        their desired professional endeavors.
